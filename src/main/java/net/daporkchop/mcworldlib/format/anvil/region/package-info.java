/**
 * My super-fast region code from PorkLib:minecraft, which in turn was initially copied from RegionMerger.
 * <p>
 * Extended to allow accessing data with arbitrary keys rather than fixed X,Z coordinates in order to support Cubic Chunks, at the cost of one additional
 * wrapper object allocation (which is probably negligable compared to the overhead of actually reading data from disk).
