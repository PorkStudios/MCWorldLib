/**
 * Interface for loading/saving chunks/sections.
 * <p>
 * Multiple save operations on the same chunks/section are ALWAYS guaranteed to be written to disk in order. If a chunk is saved, modified, and saved
 * again before the first save operation was completed, the implementation must ensure that, once both save operations are complete, it is the second
 * one that is present on disk.
 * <p>
 * When a world storage is released, it must block until all queued write operations are completed.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class are expected to be safely usable from multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * An instance of a world storage operating in read-only mode may choose to apply a variety of optimizations for the sake of performance. Chunks/sections
 * loaded by a read-only world storage are not guaranteed to be distinct objects, and may share object identity or be distinct objects sharing a
 * reference the same data. This behavior is permitted under the reasonable assumption that a world opened in read-only mode will not be modified in
 * memory either. On the other hand, a read-write world storage must always return distinct chunk/section instances that do not share any
 * references to mutable data.
